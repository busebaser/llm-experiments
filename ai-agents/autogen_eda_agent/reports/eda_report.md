**Insights:**
- The dataset contains 973 rows and 15 columns.
- Missing values were imputed using the mean of each column.
- Histograms were generated for age, heart_rate, duration, and calories (if present). Scatter plots with trendlines were generated for duration vs calories and heart_rate vs calories (if both columns exist).
